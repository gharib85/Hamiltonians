# Hamiltonians
This repository contain scripts for creating Hamiltonians for modeling the optical and transport properties of different complex systems.

## Available systems
List of current Hamiltonians:
* Spiral, spiral two-dimensional structure
* VibronicFrenkel, Holstein Hamiltonian for linear aggregate

## Auxillary modules
The spectral module allow the calculation of absorption spectra to test the Hamiltonians
The structure module allow the visualization of 3D structures (with vpython).
